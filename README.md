# Marlin 3D Printer Firmware
full build of marlin for the BTT octopus 1.1 on an ender 3 frame, with dual z auto leveling, bltouch 3.1 and basic creality lcd

should be used with octoprint etc.

this has not been tested yet. use at your own risk, and check through, as this as i havent compiled this software in about 2 years now - so there may be missing options.

it might be good for a base for your octopus build?

props to marlin fw peeps for all the good stuff they provide.
